- OCB Claim Auto Repair Block
	- <https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/1705>
	- The Block is based on a storage chest, as you need to put the necessary repair materials into it.
	It will randomly check blocks in its perimeter if they need repair and if the required materials are in storage.
	If both requirements are met, the block will start to be repaired.
	This will take some time and the repair sound will be played while repair is undergoing.
	If the block is damaged during that process, the whole repair will be aborted.
	Also only blocks that are within a claim you belong to (e.g. can pickup items) are repaired.

	include the 4 additional corner blocks; leveling a 3x3 grid.

- The Boating/Jetski Modlet:
  - <https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/1015> <https://www.nexusmods.com/7daystodie/mods/1451>
  - Launch: Place the JetSki on/in water in a 'shallow water' area that has fairly flat ground underneath, if you have no shallow water in your map then build a small launch dock using standard blocks, add some fuel to the JetSki and off you go. The will not work on land (It may move very very slightly due to Motor torque but will have no steering or control over direction)
  - Controls: Standard WASD controls for this version as it is based on the motorcycle and the JetSki can now be steered with the mouse like a standard vehicle. The new JetSki can 'hop' using the same functions as the motorcycle to avoid any obstacles that may be in the water and is also very hard to sink it.
  - S will act as brake and spacebar will stop the JetSki quicker.
